# Caesar cipher
This is a simple program to work with the Caesar cipher.

____
## Work description
At the beginning you need to choose what the program will do with the data: encode or decode. Thereafter, program gets set of words or sentences and  performs processing regarding the operating mode. During the encoding process, the program replaces the character of the source text with the character that is to the right of "n" cells in the alphabet. When action is decoding, it is the opposite of the encoding (shift to the left by "n"). "n" is introduced separately. All processing takes place in one class (process) in two functions (encode; decode).
